Subject: [PATCH 29/29] arm64: dts: beacon-renesom-baseboard: Fix Audio
 clocking on beta hardware

The audio on alpha hardware did not support both 44.1 and 48KHz clocks.
This functionality was added in beta hardware, which required some
changing of how the clocks were wired.

This patch fixes the audio clocking on beta hardware to support both.
