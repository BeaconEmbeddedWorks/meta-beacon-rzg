Subject: [PATCH 65/65] arm64: dts: beacon-renesom: Fix broken video on Pilot

The Pilot boards changed a GPIO expander which controls the LVDS
panel, touch controller and backlight for the LVDS panel. When
the gpio-expander could not enumerate, the dependent functions
failed.  Fix this by updating the device tree to the new gpio
expander part and the new corresponding i2c address.  The original
change was done to address LCD flicker and/or unwanted backlight.

Fixes: RSOM-228
Fixes: RSOM-357
